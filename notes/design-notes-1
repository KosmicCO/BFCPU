+   increment at pointer
-   decrement at pointer
[   jump forward to corresponding bracket if zero at pointer   
]   jump back to corresponding bracket                                      (Implementation: no increment program counter)
.   writes from pointer at address in register to write-only tape
,   reads from address in register from the read-only tape to pointer
