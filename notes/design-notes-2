=====Peripheral Interfaces=====

Most will have a cpu lead command structure such that the cpu initiates communication to the peripheral and leads reading from peripherals.

Common codes:

0x0000: Peripheral Information (reading returns general peripheral info)

peripherals will generally follow commands promptly after recieving them.

-----Keyboard------------------

The keyboard will store key presses and return them to the cpu when prompted

0x0000: Peripheral Information (info stream)
0x0001: Get key inputs (key stream)

If there is no new key to server, returns 0x0000

-----Terminal------------------

The terminal will store the screen state (detailed by character usage).

0x0000: Peripheral Information (info stream)
0x0001: Send charcode stream (utf-8 codes, end with 0x0000)
0x0002: Receive Terminal Information (features flags)
0x0003: Send Terminal commands (see chart)
